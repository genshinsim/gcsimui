# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init svelte@next

# create a new project in my-app
npm init svelte@next my-app
```

> Note: the `@next` is temporary

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:

```bash
npm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `npm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.

## Updating

To update the repo, do the following:
1. Ensure that the main gcsim repo is up-to-date with any desired changes
2. In the directory root, run `scripts/bump.sh "[TYPE]"`, where `[TYPE]` can be any of `major`, `minor`, or `patch` (usually you want patch)
3. Update the `release-notes.txt` file appropriately with updates from the main repo
4. Push to the repo, which triggers the Github workflow to rebuild and redeploy
